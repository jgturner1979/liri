Welcome to the LIRI bot!  Better than your phone's search function, who's voice recognition isn't always the best.

There are 4 command functions:

Movies - "movie-this"
Songs - "spotify-this-song"
Concerts - "concert-this"
Do What I say - "do-what-it-says"

To activate the bot, type into the terminal or git bash: node liri.js "put command here" "name of a movie"
